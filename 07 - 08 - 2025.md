# Topics Discussed
## The Scout Drone Battery is finalized as: 13,000 mAh 6S 

## Delivery Drone: Subsystem Weight Reduction Updates
### Structure  
Original Weight: Over 2,000g  
Current Weight: Under 1,000g  
Discussion: The structure of the drone presented an impressive 50%+ weight reduction, achieved through optimized materials and improved design methodology. Further testing for integrity and rigidity is ongoing.

### Avionics
Original Weight: 200g  
Current Weight: 120g  
Discussion: Downsizing and component integration have reduced avionics weight by 40%. The next steps involve ESC finalization and Current management

### Propulsion System
Original Weight: Over 2,500g  
Current Weight: 800g  
Discussion: A substantial weight saving was accomplished by selecting lighter, high-performance components and re-evaluating mounting hardware. Verification of thermal limits and performance under load is pending.

### Payload Mechanism
Original Weight: Over 1,600g  
Current Weight: 880g  
Discussion: Nearly halving the payload mechanismâ€™s mass was possible by reengineering the mechanical layout and choosing lighter actuator solutions. The team will continue optimizing the holding fixtures.

### Battery  
Original Weight: 10,000g  
Current Weight: 2,500g  
Discussion: Battery selection now meets project endurance requirements with a marked 75% weight reduction. Cycle-life and power supply consistency to be tested in the upcoming trials.

### Component Selections

Motor: Specified as MN5008, 400 KV; expected to provide the required thrust at a reduced overall weight.  
Propeller: Selected 17 * 5.8; optimized for efficiency with the new lighter system design.  
ESC: Yet to be finalized. The ESC is yet to be evaluated to match both the motor KV rating and expected current loads.

### Action Items & Next Steps

- Finalize selection of ESC after compatibility and reliability trials.
- Create CAD models under the given weight constraint
- Document all necessary calculations for power budget and current consumption
- An innovative approach for paylaod delivery mechanism
