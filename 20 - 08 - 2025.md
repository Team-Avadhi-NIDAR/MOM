# Tsaala Aerosapce Review
### Tsaala Aerospace is agreeing with our design, but components can have a upgradation and structure can be optimized.
Company  |  Component | 
| ----- | ---- |
Battery | Revogreen | 
Reflex Drive | Electronics Speed Controller | 
SR Aerospace | Propeller | 
BonV Aerospace | Strcutural Frame | 
Sierra Aerospace | GPS And Flight Controller | 

### The cost might even go lower with the quotation recieved from companies
### The Strucutre being an iterative process, will contitnue to be reworked
### Developments to be carried out (Camera - flight computer - flight controller) .Simulate the working before placing onboard UAV
### To produce data sets for human-detection, work is done on Isaac Simulator
### Skydroid T10 can use Skydroid T12
### Change from Raspberry pi 5 to ROS 2 would be a great change to the system
